# What Was Fixed - Red Door Management Website

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The website had all image files with hash-based names (like `08b2a8d9679e7dd92da1f3372837d4b1908e039d.png`) instead of descriptive names, making it impossible to deploy and maintain.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Image Organization**
- Created `src/images/` directory
- Renamed all 25+ images from hash names to descriptive names:
  - `08b2a8d9679e7dd92da1f3372837d4b1908e039d.png` → `red-door-text-logo.png`
  - `2f337b1e13c6392ad948406d06081be5232184a4.png` → `red-door-logo.png`
  - `432228c191ff5ca1339b663ea5ccc3cc3a72f9a8.png` → `edward-chapman.png`
  - And 22+ more images...

### 2. **Code Updates**
- Updated all React components to use correct image paths
- Fixed imports in:
  - `App.tsx` and `App-production.tsx`
  - `ServicesOverviewSection.tsx`
  - `PhoenixAreaSection.tsx`
  - `ContactPage.tsx`
  - `MultiFamilyRentalsPage.tsx`
  - `VacationRentalsPage.tsx`
  - All import files in `src/imports/`

### 3. **TypeScript Support**
- Added `src/types/images.d.ts` for proper TypeScript support
- Declared module types for all image formats (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)

### 4. **Build Process**
- Installed all dependencies (`npm install`)
- Successfully built production version (`npm run build`)
- Verified all images are properly processed and optimized
